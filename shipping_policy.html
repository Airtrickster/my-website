                <p>When an order is placed in the Platform, you have the following delivery options:</p>
                <p><strong> Delivery</strong></p>
                <p>We have engaged independent service providers to deliver the Products to your designated address. To avoid delay or cancellation of delivery, you have to ensure that you are compliant with the independent service provider’s shipping restrictions and its terms and conditions. If you will not be personally available to receive your delivery, please provide an authorization letter and a government-issued ID to an authorized representative for timely releasing of your order.</p>
                <p><strong>Store Pickup</strong></p>
                <p>Products purchased which are for store pick-up (also known as “Click &amp; Collect”) are subject to store/branch’s pick-up guidelines and restrictions and the</p>
                <ol>
                <li>When the Product is ready for pick-up, you will receive an email and/or SMS containing message that the Product/s is available for pick-up at your chosen Click &amp; Collect store branch. Ordered Products may only be picked up at the Click &amp; Collect store branch chosen during the check out process.</li>
                <li>SMS sent to you will also contain a One-Time Pin code (OTP). Present your OTP to the Click &amp; Collect representative of the chosen store branch.</li>
                <li>If the OTP has been lost for whatever reason, you have to contact Customer Care to request for resending of OTP. The OTP will only be sent to the mobile number provided during registration.</li>
                <li>If the product stored for pick-up is different from the product purchased through the Platform, you may return the item at any of the Customer Service counters of any store branches for proper checking and processing in accordance with our Return and Exchange Policy.</li>
                <li>You have five (5) days from receipt of the e-mail and/or SMS to pick-up the Product purchased through the Platform.  After the lapse of the said period, we will not be under any obligation to ensure the availability of the Product at the designated branch. We may cancel the order and refund the payment made, if any, in accordance with our Return and Exchange Policy.</li>
                <li>You may not change the Click &amp; Collect store branch once the order has been processed.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Delays may unfortunately occur due to high volume of orders, logistics limitations, geographic restrictions, inclement weather and other instances that are beyond our control. However, we will do our best to prepare your orders and have them ready for your pick up or deliver them the soonest we can.</p>
