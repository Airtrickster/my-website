                Due to the current limitations brought about by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, 
                kindly allow for some allowances on the delivery timeframe as our 3rd party couriers may experience some difficulties in picking up and delivering your orders.

                For Metro Manila orders, the standard delivery timeframe is 5-7 working days, 
                with day 1 starting a day after the order is completed and paid. 

                For outside Metro Manila orders, the standard delivery timeframe is 7-10 working days, 
                with day 1 starting a day after the order is completed and paid. 

                For international orders, the standard delivery timeframe is 10-15 working days, 
                with day 1 starting a day after the order is completed and paid.
